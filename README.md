Application is mainly created for integrating with another ***"Do not Disturb"*** application.

allowing to make camera snapshots and persist them, when macbook lid is opened.

Application is taking 2 photos (one after 1 sec, another after 5sec) and store in defined directory, which by default could be */Users/michalbogdal/Library/Application Support/camera-snapshotter/camera*
