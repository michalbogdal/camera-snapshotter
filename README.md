**Camera Snapshotter**

Simple application in **Electron** and **WebcamJS** to take snapshots from camera and persist in the disk. 
Application is mainly created for integrating with another ***"Do not Disturb"*** application.

allowing to make camera snapshots and saving them when macbook lid is opened.

Application is taking 2 photos (one after 1 sec, another after 5sec) and store in a defined path, which by default could be */Users/michalbogdal/Library/Application Support/camera-snapshotter/camera*

Example image file: cam_1566946799874.png

All settings are stored using ***electron-settings*** module which saves config in */Users/michalbogdal/Library/Application Support/camera-snapshotter/Settings*
